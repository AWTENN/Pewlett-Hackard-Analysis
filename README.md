# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

- This analysis was performed to look at the upcoming employees that are of retiring age and see how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program.


## Results

Here are the main four results drawn from the files created:

- Most of the staff that are of retiring age are either senior engineers or senior staff.
- Only 2 of the employees that are of retiring age are managers.
- 4502 employees that are of retiring age are technique leaders, I do not know if that is an important position but that is a lot of leaders that are of retiring age.
- The rest of the employees that are of retiring age are either just staff and engineers or asst. engineers.

##Summary

Over 90,000 roles will need to be filled, with over 60,000 of those roles being senior positions or manager/leader positions.

There will be 1549 qualified, retirement age employees that could mentor the next generation, but I believe we would need to extend the range of years that we are looking at to create more leadership and senior positions to combat the over 60,000 employees in those positions that are close to retirement.
